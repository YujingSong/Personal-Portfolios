Yujing Song's Personal Projects Brief Introduction
======================
## Vanguard Capstone Project
With the growth of the capital market in the US, more institutional investors emerged. Vanguard, as the sponsor
of this project, is interested in knowing how other market participants are approaching investments and new
investment signals that are emerging. Based on this idea, we dived into 13F data, a quarterly financial report from
all big institutional investors with over $100 million in asset under management, which discloses their equity
holding details.<br>

We want to use this data to get better understanding of the institutional investors and their characteristics, which
gives instructions on which investors to follow. Also, understanding changes in investor behavior through time
by looking at their portfolio holding changes could give insights on when to follow the actions of some smart
investors.<br>

## Clean Energy Porject
UMM has long valued renewable energy and sustainability and has invested in solar cells and windturbines. 
Since they both however heavily depend on time and weather conditions, the power harvestedfluctuates. 
They produce, on average, about 60% of the electricity used on campus,but there are times when we produce more than the campus uses. When these specific occasions arise,the power harvested
cannot fully be utilized and is sent back to the grid due to the lack of local storage. 
The rate we receive for contributing this excess electricity is typically substantially less than the rate at which the university buys power from the grid. 
We are working on a real time power monitoring system that compares the power consumption of the entire campus with the power from renewables. If, for instance, students had our
access to our forecasting system on their phones, they could see when the campus is likely to be producing excess electricity and plan energy intensive activities like laundry etc.

## Single Image Super Resolution
Super-Resolution (SR) of a single image is a classic problem in computer vision. 
The goal of image super-resolution is to produce a high-resolution image from a low-resolution image. 
This paper presents a popular model, super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN), to solve this problem. 
This paper also examines an improvement to SRCNN using a methodology known as generative adversarial network (GAN) which is better at adding texture details to the
high resolution output.

## IMDB 5000 Research Report
(The report with R code)<br>
* Analyzed the influencing factors of film quality in R by using data in website The Movie Data Base.<br>
* Used linear regression models to explore the relation among budgets, movie scores, and product studios.<br>
* Created a classification tree to find the factors that influence the quality of a film.<br>
* Visualized the analyzing results including mapped the regional distribution of high-quality movies, time-series line charts for the changes of movie types, draw a word cloud for key words, plotted the commercial success and critical acclaim based on different directors.<br>


## Sunshine Journal Portfolio
* Built an emotional tracker web-based application framework for local hospital.<br>
* Stored usersâ€™ emotional information in Mango database and provided yearly and weekly emotional information summarization charts across using chart.js with filters on emotions and date.<br>
* Edited journals in cards form with filters for titles and contents.<br>
* Optimized the website using Angular2 and Typescript.<br>
* Organized and record Agile development meetings in ZenHub, contacted with customers, 4 iterations in total.<br>

## Small Projects
#### Files included in this folder:
* Community Contritubtion.pdf:<br>
Created a cheat sheet of world cloud package for R users.<br>
* Interactive Boxplot.html:<br>
Create an interactive boxplot webpage.<br>
How to play with it?
  1. Download the 'Interactive Boxplot.html'
  2. Open the html file
  3. On the leftside, choose 'Add points' (default choose). Click on the blue area whereever you want. A beautiful boxplot will show up based on the points you added, and the rightside will automaticall calculate outliers (the outlier will be marked as red in the boxplot),upper/lower whisker,median,first quantile and third quantile.
  4. To remove the points, choose 'Remove points' on the top left, and click the points you want to remove on the plot, the boxplot will automatically change based on your change.
